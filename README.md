# mapGenerator

Open this project in Unity with version 2020.3.30f1 or newer. When the project opens, you may need to drags the scenes into the hierarchy. The hierarchy should have the "UIScene" and the "MapScene" with the UIScene loaded and the MapScene unloaded. If the hierarchy only has and "Untitled" scene or a "Sample" scene, add the UIScene and the MapScene and remove the "Untitled" Scene or the "Sample" scene. Ensure the UIScene is the only loaded scene when running the project.
